    "**K3D** is an interactive 3D visualization library for Python, designed to work seamlessly within Jupyter Notebooks. It leverages WebGL through a custom JavaScript frontend to provide real-time rendering of complex 3D scenes directly in the browser. K3D supports a wide range of 3D primitives such as point clouds, meshes, lines, vectors, and volumes, making it ideal for scientific computing, education, and visual analytics. One of its standout features is the ability to interactively rotate, zoom, and pan scenes, as well as dynamically update geometries and attributes through Python code. This makes K3D particularly powerful for creating visual explanations, animations, and hands-on experiments in computer graphics courses."

    "## Coordinate System and Axes Helper\n",
    "\n",
    "As already seen in Lab 1, in 3D computer graphics, a coordinate system defines how objects are positioned and oriented in space. Most commonly, a right-handed Cartesian coordinate system is used, where each point in space is described by three values (x, y, z). The X-axis typically points to the right, the Y-axis upward, and the Z-axis outward (or inward, depending on the convention). Understanding this system is fundamental for modeling, transforming, and visualizing 3D objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "An axes helper is a visual aid that displays the orientation of these three axes, often using colored lines (e.g., red for X, green for Y, and blue for Z). It helps users interpret the spatial arrangement of objects in a scene, especially when rotating the camera or applying transformations. In visualization tools like K3D, manually adding axes using lines serves as a custom implementation of an axes helper, enabling better spatial awareness and easier debugging of 3D scenes."

    "The line `plot = k3d.plot(axes=['\\\\alpha', '\\\\beta', '\\\\gamma'])` creates a 3D plot using the K3D library with **custom axis labels**. Instead of the default `x`, `y`, and `z` labels, this example uses Greek letters: α (alpha), β (beta), and γ (gamma). These labels are specified using LaTeX-style strings, which K3D supports for mathematical formatting. Custom axis labels are especially useful when visualizing domain-specific data, such as angular parameters, tensor components, or coordinate transformations in physics or engineering, where traditional x/y/z labels may not be meaningful. Calling `plot.display()` renders the interactive 3D plot in the Jupyter notebook."

    "## Camera Manipulation in K3D\n",
    "\n",
    "K3D allows users to interactively manipulate the camera view within a 3D scene, enabling rotation, zoom, and panning using the mouse. Beyond these interactive controls, the camera can also be programmatically controlled through the `plot.camera` property. This property accepts a list of nine values that define the camera's configuration: the first three values specify the camera position, the next three define the point it is looking at (target), and the final three represent the up direction vector. By adjusting these parameters, users can script precise camera views, simulate camera motion, or align the view to follow moving objects. Additionally, camera auto-fitting can be controlled with `plot.camera_auto_fit`, which when disabled allows full manual control over the camera's state. This capability is particularly important in applications such as simulation playback, animations, and camera path visualization in robotics or cinematography.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1. Visualizing Camera and Object Trajectories in 3D\n",
    "\n",
    "The following example creates a 3D visualization that simulates and displays the trajectories of a camera and an object moving through space. First, a `k3d.plot()` is initialized, and a single arrow is added using `k3d.vectors` to represent a direction in space from the origin to the point (1, 1, 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Two trajectories are then generated:\n",
    "- `cam_traj`: the camera trajectory, forming a spiral-like path in 3D space.\n",
    "- `object_traj`: the object's trajectory, which follows a wavy and non-linear path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both trajectories are sampled with 100 points (`N = 100`) and visualized using `k3d.line`. The camera trajectory is shown with the default color and a simple shader, while the object trajectory is colored red (`0xff0000`) and rendered with a mesh shader for a more pronounced appearance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The current positions of the camera and the object are also marked using `k3d.points`, initialized at the same starting point `[0, -1, 0]`. These can later be updated dynamically to animate movement along their respective paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup is particularly useful for visualizing motion planning, path-following, or camera tracking scenarios in robotics, animation, or simulation tasks. \n",

A sequence of 4×4 model matrices is generated to represent rotation around the Z-axis over time. The rotation angle is calculated as a function of time using a full 360° (2π radians) cycle divided into 60 discrete steps. Each matrix not only performs the rotation but also includes a translation along the X-axis by 1 unit, allowing the object to orbit around the origin instead of rotating in place.\n",

The K3D plot is then displayed, and the object’s transformation is updated in a loop by assigning each matrix in the sequence to its `model_matrix` attribute. This results in a smooth, animated motion of the point tracing a circular path in the XY-plane. The example showcases how transformation matrices can be used in K3D to simulate object motion and is particularly useful for understanding rotational kinematics, orbital motion, and animation principles in 3D graphics.\n"

    "### Example 4. Combine Multiple Objects with Different Transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates how to display multiple 3D objects within the same scene, each with a different transformation applied. A red point is placed at a fixed position, while a green point is defined at the same initial location but transformed using a rotation matrix. Specifically, a 90-degree rotation around the Z-axis is applied to the green point by setting its `model_matrix`, which results in its position being visually rotated relative to the red point. This allows for a clear comparison between the original and transformed object. Combining multiple transformed objects in a shared coordinate system is essential in 3D graphics for tasks such as object manipulation, hierarchical modeling, and illustrating the effects of spatial transformations.\n"

    "\n",
    "Point clouds are one of the most fundamental data structures in 3D graphics, used to represent collections of points in space without explicit connectivity between them. In this example, a point cloud is created by generating 1,000 random 3D coordinates within a cube centered at the origin. These coordinates are passed to the `k3d.points` function, which visualizes them as small, uniformly sized red dots in the 3D space. By displaying this point cloud in an interactive K3D plot, users can rotate, zoom, and pan the view to gain an intuitive understanding of the spatial distribution of points. This kind of visualization is essential in areas such as 3D scanning, LiDAR data analysis, and early stages of 3D reconstruction pipelines.\n"

    "In this example, a structured point cloud is generated to form the surface of a sphere using spherical coordinates. Each point is then assigned a color based on its Z-coordinate (height), effectively visualizing a scalar field on the surface of the sphere. The scalar values are normalized and mapped to RGB color values using a simple gradient. This technique is useful in scientific visualization where scalar fields—such as temperature, elevation, or pressure—are represented through color.

To visualize the structure, a threshold is applied to convert the continuous values into a binary volume—voxels with values above the threshold are set to 1, and others to 0.
